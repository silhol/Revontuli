Sending e-mail from Python script:

(1)	Create g-mail account

(2)	Install google client libraries into python, https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python

(3)	Massage google account to give access to your script (this is a bit tricky):

(a) You need to create a project https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project 
(b) You need to create credentials: https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/use-gmail-api-in-python user your own e-mail address
(c) Enable the API: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/enable-apis (you want gmail api)
(d) Authorization for the API: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/auth-overview for your own e-mail
(e) Chose Scope for the script:  https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/configure-oauth-consent#choose-scopes 
    https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes#gmail 
    Suggest to go with: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
    Has to be added under API & Services OAuth consent screen (edit app registration)
(f) Test user:  the e-mail address from before 

(4)	Create testing script:
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python 
Run the test script, you should see something like "you got access to an app ....."
